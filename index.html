              <p class="bold">Lead Lifecycle Designer</p>
              <p>This web-based app is designed to track leads for a service-oriented business. When a lead is entered, the app will automatically add upcoming "events" to the lead. These events will be automated emails, automated text messages, and reminders to call the lead. The emails will be eventually handled by Send Grid while the text messages will be eventually handled by Twillio.</p>
